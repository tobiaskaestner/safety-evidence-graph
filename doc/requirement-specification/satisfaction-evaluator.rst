Satisfaction Evaluator
======================

The satisfaction evaluator answers one question about every requirement in
the graph: is it satisfied? Its requirements give the two rules that answer it
— one for a requirement nothing refines, one for a requirement something
refines — together with the properties that make the answer worth having. It
reads the whole graph rather than a scope, it repeats, and it changes
nothing.

.. sreq:: Leaf satisfaction rule
   :id: SEG-SREQ-006
   :refines: SEG-SYS-002

   The satisfaction evaluator shall report a leaf requirement as satisfied
   when, and only when, it carries at least one active verifies edge, at least
   one active implements edge, and every test specification verifying it has a
   passing outcome.

.. sreq:: Non-leaf satisfaction rule
   :id: SEG-SREQ-007
   :refines: SEG-SYS-002

   The satisfaction evaluator shall report a non-leaf requirement as satisfied
   when, and only when, every requirement refining it is satisfied and every
   verifies or implements edge it carries is active.

.. sreq:: Satisfaction is evaluated over the whole graph
   :id: SEG-SREQ-008
   :refines: SEG-SYS-002

   The satisfaction evaluator shall determine satisfaction from the whole
   graph, never from a subset of it.

.. sreq:: Verdicts repeat
   :id: SEG-SREQ-009
   :refines: SEG-SYS-002

   The satisfaction evaluator shall produce the same verdict for the same
   graph on every evaluation.

.. sreq:: Evaluation leaves the graph unchanged
   :id: SEG-SREQ-010
   :refines: SEG-SYS-002

   The satisfaction evaluator shall leave the graph unchanged when evaluating
   it.
