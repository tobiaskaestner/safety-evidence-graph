Requirement Specification
=========================

The affirmatrix requirement specification — the first half of the repo's own
safety evidence graph (the dogfood case). IDs follow the SEG conventions:
``SEG-SYS-nnn`` (system), ``SEG-SREQ-nnn`` (software).

The system requirements are collected on one page. The software requirements
are grouped by the component that owns them, so each page reads as the
contract for one part of the engine. A requirement's page is decided by its
subject, not by its parent, so refinement links cross pages freely.
