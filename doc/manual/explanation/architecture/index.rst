Architecture
============

arc42-shaped architecture documentation (introduction, context, solution
strategy, building blocks, crosscutting concepts) — to be populated as the
engine lands.

The engine's decomposition into components is ratified in the decision
records: ADR-0004 maps the component vocabulary onto packages under
``src/affirmatrix``, and the per-module docstrings name the component each
module realizes. The pages below cover what the tool guarantees and what is
currently in scope to build.
