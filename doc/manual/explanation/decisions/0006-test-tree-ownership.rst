0006. Test-tree ownership: developer tests, verification tests, fixtures
=========================================================================

Status
------

Accepted, 2026-07-25.

Context
-------

Path-based ownership (ADR-0002) gives the Software Engineer
``src/affirmatrix/`` and the Test Engineer ``tests/``. Two instructions
cut across that boundary. The SWE is required to work test-first, so the
SWE necessarily authors test code; and the iteration-0 would-be store — a
fixture the SWE hand-authors — is placed in ``tests/fixtures/``. As
written, the SWE cannot follow the method without writing in the TE's
path.

The two kinds of test are genuinely different artifacts, not merely
differently-authored ones. The TE's tests are **verification evidence**:
each realizes a ``SEG-TS-nnn`` specification, states that specification in
a ``:test-id:`` marker and the requirement it demonstrates in a
``:verifies:`` marker, and becomes a TestOutcome node in the case. The
SWE's tests are
**developer tests**: they drive the design, they are not graph
participants, and nothing in the evidence graph refers to them.

Decision
--------

The test tree is partitioned by artifact kind, one directory per owner:

============================  =======  ==============================
Path                          Owner    Holds
============================  =======  ==============================
``tests/unit/``               SWE      developer tests (test-first)
``tests/fixtures/``           SWE      fixture data, incl. the
                                       would-be store
``tests/specification/``      TE       the verification suite
                                       realizing ``SEG-TS-nnn``
``tests/conftest.py``         shared   changed by proposal only
============================  =======  ==============================

A single pytest root is retained; ``testpaths = ["tests"]`` is unchanged.
Ownership stays **directory-granular**, so the standing rule — never two
agents in the same path — survives verbatim, one level deeper.

Rejected alternatives: a separate top-level tree for developer tests
(cleanest boundary, but two pytest roots and a layout an OSS contributor
would not expect, against ADR-0002's clone-and-build motive); and tests
inside ``src/affirmatrix/`` (no brief amendment needed, but it ships test
code and fixture data in the wheel and hides the suite from contributors).

Consequences
------------

- SWE brief, path scope: **Edit** gains ``tests/unit/`` and
  ``tests/fixtures/``; the line "``tests/`` … are the Test Engineer's
  paths" narrows to ``tests/specification/`` and
  ``doc/test-specification/``.
- TE brief, path scope: **Edit** narrows from ``tests/`` to
  ``tests/specification/``; **Read** gains ``tests/unit/`` and
  ``tests/fixtures/``.
- ``tests/conftest.py`` follows the precedent already set for the shared
  documentation federation config: common infrastructure, changed by
  proposal at a checkpoint, not unilaterally.
- The tree documents the distinction it encodes: a reader can see which
  tests are evidence and which are development.
- The would-be store lands at ``tests/fixtures/would_be_store/``, exactly
  where the SWE brief says — the contradiction is removed by widening the
  SWE's scope, not by moving the fixture.
- ``pyproject.toml`` remains unowned by any brief; it needs an owner
  eventually (flagged, not decided here).
