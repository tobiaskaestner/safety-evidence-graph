"""The graph builder (SEG-SREQ-004, -016, -031).

The builder is the narrow gate every record passes through on its way into the
graph, so most of its behaviour is about what it refuses. Two refusals are
ratified — a refines cycle, and a kind the vocabulary does not declare — and
both exist for the same reason: each would otherwise produce a graph that looks
complete and seals to a perfectly valid root while being wrong. A graph missing
records nobody noticed were dropped is the more dangerous of the two, because
nothing downstream can tell.

What the builder must *not* refuse matters just as much. An edge pointing at a
node that is not present is not an error here: that is a broken edge, and
deciding so needs both record streams, which is the suspect detector's job.
