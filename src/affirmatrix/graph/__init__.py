"""The graph builder — records to the in-memory graph.

Assembles node and edge records into the typed graph the rest of the engine
reads. It is the narrow gate every record passes through, so most of what it
does is refuse: a kind the vocabulary does not declare (SEG-SREQ-031), a cycle
or self-loop in the refines relation (SEG-SREQ-004), a local identifier used
twice (ADR-0007). Each refusal exists because the alternative is a graph that
looks complete, seals to a perfectly valid root, and is wrong.

An edge that was never affirmed is reported as pending (SEG-SREQ-016), judged
by whether it carries a hash it was affirmed against rather than by what its
record claims. Beyond that the builder carries recorded state rather than
recomputing it: the builder assembles, the suspect detector derives (ADR-0004).

What it deliberately does *not* refuse is as important. An edge pointing at a
node that is not present is built, not rejected — a dangling endpoint is a
broken edge, and reaching that verdict needs both record streams, which the
suspect detector has and this component does not.

Iteration-0 backlog items B7 (build) and B8 (cycles).
