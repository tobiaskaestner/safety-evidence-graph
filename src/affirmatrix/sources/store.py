"""The store loader — iteration 0's record source over the would-be store.

Reads the hand-authored fixture under ``tests/fixtures/would_be_store/`` and
produces the *current* record stream: node records whose content hashes are the
digests of the content the store holds, and the edges declared alongside them.

**Test scaffolding.** No requirements attach to this adapter; it exists so the
engine has an input before record production is built, and it retires when the
real extractors and the requirements reader land. It is the "would-be store" —
it holds content and is deliberately not schema-validated, unlike the
affirmation store, which holds hashes and references and always is.

The layout it reads is described in the store's own README, which is the
authority on the format. Three properties of the reading are the loader's:

* **Content is hashed verbatim** — the bytes on disk, with no stripping and no
  normalization. A loader that tidied content on the way in would make the hash
  a function of the loader rather than of what the store holds.
* **Every edge is pending.** The store holds content, not affirmations, so no
  edge in it carries a hash it was affirmed against. Affirmed state belongs to
  the recorded stream, which is the affirmation store's to supply.
* **A store that cannot be read raises.** Never a short record stream: a
  truncated stream builds a smaller graph that seals to a perfectly valid root
  over content nobody meant to omit.

What it does not do is judge the records. A duplicate identifier, an undeclared
kind, an edge to a node that is not there — each is somebody's error, but not
this component's to report: the graph builder refuses the first two and the
suspect detector decides the third. A producer says what the store holds.
