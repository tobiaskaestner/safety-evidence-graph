"""The layout the affirmation store owns, and the confinement rule over it.

ADR-0008 makes the store the only writer under the write root and gives it the
directory names, the file naming and the mapping from a record kind to the
document that holds it. All of that lives here, so a path is assembled in one
place and every path the store opens passes through one check.

The kind-to-document mappings are written out rather than derived from the kind
spelling. A derived rule would let a new kind acquire a home by accident; an
explicit map makes giving it one a deliberate edit, and the suite checks the
map's keys against the taxonomy so the two cannot drift apart.
