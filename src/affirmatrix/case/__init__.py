"""The affirmation store — persistence of the graph, both directions.

The only component that touches persisted graph artifacts: node and edge hash
records, review events, and sealed evidence packages under ``case/``
(SEG-SYS-007). It persists hashes and references only — the content those
hashes cover never reaches it (SEG-SREQ-018) — and it is the single point at
which schema validation is applied, rejecting an invalid record rather than
writing it (SEG-SREQ-019) and reproducing every record it wrote unchanged when
that record is read back (SEG-SREQ-020).

Its **read face is a record source** (ADR-0004): persisted edge records
carrying their stored edge hash and link state enter the engine through the
record-source protocol, so drift detection takes two record sources in and
gives one derived state out, and the graph builder never learns whether a hash
came from disk or from a producer. Its write face is exclusive.

Write policy (ADR-0008): writes land in place in the working ``case/`` by
default, each record appearing only once it is complete (SEG-SREQ-022), never
removing a record unless removal was requested (SEG-SREQ-023), and never
outside the write root it was given (SEG-SREQ-021). An output directory can
relocate that root. The tool performs no version-control operations of its
own — the review surface is the working tree, and a maintainer records it.

**The write face, as built.** One class over one write root. The root is always
a parameter and never a default, so relocating the whole store is passing a
different path and nothing else; the store never learns whether it is writing
the working case or a scratch copy. Records are written in batches because a
per-kind collection document is the unit of atomicity: one call rewrites one
document per kind it touches, whole, by rename. A rewrite carries through every
entry the call did not mention, so a short input stream cannot prune the case;
removal is a separate operation that names what it removes.

A case is self-describing. The store seeds a fresh root with the schemas and
the shared JSON-LD context it carries as package data, and thereafter validates
against the copy in the case rather than the copy in the package, so the tool
and an auditor reading the same directory reach the same verdict. It never
writes over a schema a case already has.

The module keeps the name ``case`` for one-word symmetry with the directory it
owns; module names denote the artifact, component names the actor.

Iteration-0 backlog items B10 (write) and B11 (read-back).
