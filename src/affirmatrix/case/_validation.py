"""Schema validation, against the copy of the schemas the case itself carries.

The store validates every entry before writing it (SEG-SREQ-019), and it
validates against ``{root}/schema/`` — the same files an auditor reads — rather
than against the copy inside the installed package. Tool and auditor then agree
by construction. The packaged copy seeds a case that has none yet and is never
written over one that does: replacing a case's schemas would be a store act,
and the tool takes none unbidden.

The schemas are read at the moment of the write, not cached for the process.
A case's schema directory is data on disk that anything may have changed since
the last write, and a validator held over from an earlier one would be judging
records against rules the case no longer states.
