"""The taxonomy provider — the built-in safety-evidence graph type.

Single internal source for the node and edge kinds (SEG-SREQ-029), which edge
kinds propagate suspicion (SEG-SREQ-030), and the content-hash names each node
kind carries (SEG-SREQ-032). Nothing else in the engine hardwires a kind name;
a record declaring a kind this provider does not declare is rejected by the
graph builder (SEG-SREQ-031) — the provider declares, the builder refuses.

This version populates the provider from constants — the built-in
safety-evidence graph type. A user-definable graph vocabulary is out of scope
and would plug in here rather than anywhere else, which is the point of routing
every kind lookup through one place.

**The spellings below are part of the integrity surface.** ADR-0005 folds the
node kind and the content-hash names into the node-hash preimage, so renaming
one re-hashes every node of that kind and sends every edge touching them
suspect. They are local tokens, not serialized ones: ``Requirement``, never
``seg:Requirement`` (ADR-0007). Treat a rename as a migration, not a tidy-up.

Iteration-0 backlog item B6.
